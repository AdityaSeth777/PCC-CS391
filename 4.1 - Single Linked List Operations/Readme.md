This code implements a singly linked list in C and provides the following operations:

Insert: This operation inserts a new node at the end of the linked list. The user is prompted to enter the data to be inserted.

Delete: This operation deletes the node with the specified data from the linked list. The user is prompted to enter the data to be deleted.

Display: This operation displays the contents of the linked list.

Reverse: This operation reverses the linked list.

Sort: This operation sorts the linked list in ascending order.

Exit: This operation exits the program.

The program runs an infinite loop that prompts the user to enter a choice. Depending on the user's choice, the corresponding operation is performed. The switch case statement is used to execute the selected operation.

The struct Node defines the structure of each node in the linked list, with two members: data and a pointer to the next node.

The insert() function takes the data to be inserted and creates a new node with this data. If the linked list is empty, the new node becomes the head of the list. Otherwise, the new node is added to the end of the list.

The delete() function takes the data to be deleted and searches for the node with this data. If the node is found, it is deleted. If the node is not found, an error message is displayed.

The display() function traverses the linked list and prints the data in each node.

The reverse() function reverses the linked list by changing the direction of the pointers.

The merge() function is a helper function that implements the merge sort algorithm to sort the linked list. It takes a pointer to the head of the linked list and splits the list into two halves. It then recursively sorts each half using sortedMerge() and merges the sorted halves using a modified version of the merge function for arrays.

The sortedMerge() function takes two pointers to linked lists and merges them into a single sorted linked list.

The split() function is a helper function used by merge(). It takes a pointer to a linked list and splits it into two halves, returning pointers to the heads of the two halves.

The sort() function simply calls merge() with a pointer to the head of the linked list to sort the list.

The main() function implements the infinite loop and prompts the user to enter a choice. Depending on the choice, the corresponding operation is performed using a switch case statement. If the user selects "Exit", the program exits.
