This code implements Horner's rule to evaluate the value of a polynomial at a given value of x. Here's how it works:

The horner() function takes three arguments: an array coeff containing the coefficients of the polynomial in ascending order of degree, an integer n representing the degree of the polynomial, and a double x representing the value of x at which to evaluate the polynomial.

The function uses recursion to evaluate the polynomial. It starts with the base case where n is 0 (i.e., the polynomial is just a constant). In this case, the function simply returns the constant coefficient coeff[0].

For the recursive case (i.e., when n is greater than 0), the function recursively evaluates the polynomial of degree n-1 at x, multiplies the result by x, and adds the n-th coefficient coeff[n]. This step follows directly from the Horner's rule formula.

In the main() function, the user is prompted to enter the degree of the polynomial n and the coefficients of the polynomial in ascending order of degree. The user is then prompted to enter the value of x at which to evaluate the polynomial. Finally, the horner() function is called with these inputs, and the result is printed to the console.

Note that the code assumes that the user will enter valid input values (i.e., a non-negative degree for the polynomial and valid coefficients and value of x). The code does not include any input validation or error handling for invalid inputs.
