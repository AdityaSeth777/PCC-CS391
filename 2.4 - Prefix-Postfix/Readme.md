Question -> Convert a prefix expression to postfix in C


The above code converts a prefix expression to postfix expression using a stack data structure. The prefix expression is first read from the user and then processed to produce the corresponding postfix expression.

The push() and pop() functions are used to implement a stack using an array. The is_operator() function checks if a given character is an operator.

The prefix_to_postfix() function takes two input parameters: the prefix expression prefix and an empty array postfix to store the corresponding postfix expression. The function first finds the length of the prefix expression using strlen() function and then reverses it using strrev() function.

The function then scans the prefix expression from left to right. If an operand is encountered, it is simply appended to the postfix expression. If an operator is encountered, two operands are popped from the stack, and the operator is placed in between the operands in the postfix expression. The resulting postfix expression is then pushed back onto the stack.

After the entire prefix expression is processed, any remaining elements in the stack are popped and appended to the postfix expression. Finally, the postfix expression is reversed again using strrev() function to get the correct order of elements.

In the main() function, the prefix expression is read from the user using scanf() function, and the prefix_to_postfix() function is called to generate the corresponding postfix expression. The resulting postfix expression is then printed to the console using printf() function.
