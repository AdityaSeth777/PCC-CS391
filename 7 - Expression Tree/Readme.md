Question -> Implement Expression tree in C


The given C program implements an expression tree data structure for evaluating a postfix expression. Here is how it works:

The program starts by defining a node structure for the expression tree, which contains a character data field and two pointers to the left and right child nodes.

The newNode function creates a new node with the given data and sets its left and right pointers to NULL.

The isOperator function checks if the given character is an operator (+, -, *, or /). If the character is an operator, the function returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.

The buildExpressionTree function takes a postfix expression as input and builds an expression tree from it. The function uses a stack to store the nodes of the expression tree. The stack is implemented as an array of pointers to nodes. The variable top keeps track of the top of the stack. The function scans the postfix expression from left to right and performs the following operations:

a. If the current character is a digit, the function creates a new node with the digit as data and pushes the node onto the stack.

b. If the current character is an operator, the function creates a new node with the operator as data and pops two nodes from the stack to use as its left and right children. The function sets the left and right pointers of the new node to the popped nodes and pushes the new node onto the stack.

After scanning the entire postfix expression, the function returns the root of the expression tree, which is the only node left on the stack.

The evaluateExpressionTree function takes the root of an expression tree as input and evaluates the expression. If the root is NULL, the function returns 0. If the root is a digit, the function converts it to an integer and returns it. If the root is an operator, the function recursively evaluates its left and right children and applies the operator to the results. The function then returns the result.

The main function prompts the user to enter a postfix expression and reads it from standard input using the scanf function. The function then calls buildExpressionTree to build an expression tree from the postfix expression and evaluateExpressionTree to evaluate the expression tree. The function prints the result of the evaluation to standard output.

Overall, the program implements an efficient algorithm for building an expression tree from a postfix expression and evaluating it using recursion. The time complexity of the buildExpressionTree function is O(n), where n is the length of the postfix expression, since it scans the entire expression once and performs constant-time operations for each character. The time complexity of the evaluateExpressionTree function is also O(n), since it visits each node of the expression tree once and performs constant-time operations for each node. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the program is O(n).
