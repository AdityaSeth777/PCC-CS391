The given code implements a menu-driven C program to implement a double-ended queue (deque) using an array. A deque is a data structure that allows insertion and deletion of elements from both ends.

The program defines a Deque structure that holds a pointer to an array (arr), indices of front and rear elements (front and rear), and the current size of the deque (size). The initDeque function initializes the deque by allocating memory for the array using malloc.

The isFull and isEmpty functions check whether the deque is full or empty, respectively. insertFront and insertRear functions insert an element at the front and rear of the deque, respectively. These functions check if the deque is full before inserting an element. If the deque is empty, the front and rear indices are set to 0. If the front index is 0 and an element is inserted at the front, it wraps around to the end of the array. Similarly, if the rear index is at the end of the array and an element is inserted at the rear, it wraps around to the beginning of the array.

deleteFront and deleteRear functions remove an element from the front and rear of the deque, respectively. These functions check if the deque is empty before removing an element. If the deque has only one element, the front and rear indices are reset to -1. If the front index is at the end of the array and an element is deleted from the front, it wraps around to the beginning of the array. Similarly, if the rear index is at the beginning of the array and an element is deleted from the rear, it wraps around to the end of the array.

display function prints the elements of the deque in order.

In the main function, a Deque object is created, and the initDeque function is called to initialize it. A menu is displayed using a while loop. The user is prompted to choose an option from the menu, and the corresponding function is called. If the user chooses an invalid option, an error message is displayed.

The program continues to display the menu until the user chooses to exit.

Overall, the program is implemented efficiently, using a circular array to avoid shifting elements during insertion and deletion, which would result in higher time complexity.
