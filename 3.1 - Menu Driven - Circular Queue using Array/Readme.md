```This is a C program to implement a circular queue using an array. The program uses a menu-driven approach to allow the user to perform various operations on the queue, such as enqueueing, dequeuing, and displaying the contents of the queue.```

The circular queue is implemented using an array with a fixed size of MAX_QUEUE_SIZE, which is defined as 10. Two variables, front and rear, are used to keep track of the front and rear of the queue, respectively. Initially, both variables are set to -1, indicating an empty queue.

The program includes four functions: isFull(), isEmpty(), enqueue(), and dequeue(). The isFull() function checks whether the queue is full by checking if the next element after the rear is the front of the queue (modulo MAX_QUEUE_SIZE is used for wrapping). The isEmpty() function checks whether the queue is empty by checking if both front and rear are -1.

The enqueue() function takes an integer parameter, which is the data to be added to the queue. If the queue is full, the function prints a message indicating that the queue is full and returns. If the queue is empty, the function sets both front and rear to 0 and adds the data to the queue. If the queue is not empty and not full, the function increments the rear by 1 (modulo MAX_QUEUE_SIZE is used for wrapping) and adds the data to the queue.

The dequeue() function removes the element at the front of the queue. If the queue is empty, the function prints a message indicating that the queue is empty and returns. If the queue has only one element, the function removes the element and sets both front and rear to -1. If the queue has more than one element, the function removes the element at the front of the queue and increments the front by 1 (modulo MAX_QUEUE_SIZE is used for wrapping).

The display() function prints the contents of the queue. If the queue is empty, the function prints a message indicating that the queue is empty and returns. Otherwise, the function iterates over the elements of the queue from front to rear (wrapping around if necessary) and prints each element.

The main() function implements the menu-driven interface. It repeatedly displays a menu of options and reads the user's choice. Depending on the choice, the appropriate function is called to perform the desired operation on the queue.

Overall, this program implements a circular queue using an array and provides a user-friendly interface for manipulating the queue.
