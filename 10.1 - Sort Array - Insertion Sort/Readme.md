This is a program to sort an array using insertion sort in C.

The program first asks the user to enter the size of the array, followed by the elements of the array. It then calls the insertion_sort function with the array and its size as arguments.

The insertion_sort function implements the insertion sort algorithm. It initializes variables i, j and key, where i represents the current index being processed, j represents the index before the current index, and key represents the value of the current element. The algorithm then loops through the array, comparing the current element with the elements before it, and shifting them to the right until the correct position for the current element is found. This is done using a nested while loop.

Once the insertion_sort function finishes sorting the array, the sorted array is printed using a for loop in the main function.

The time complexity of insertion sort is O(n^2) in the worst case, but in the best case, when the array is already sorted, it has a time complexity of O(n).
