Question -> Write a C program to convert a given infix expression
to postfix expression



This C program converts an infix expression to postfix expression using the input from the user. The program uses the stack data structure to implement the algorithm to convert the expression. The steps involved in the algorithm are as follows:

Create a stack to store the operators.
Traverse the infix expression from left to right.
If an operand is encountered, add it to the postfix expression.
If an opening parenthesis is encountered, push it onto the stack.
If an operator is encountered, check its precedence with the top operator of the stack. If the precedence of the operator is higher, push it onto the stack. If the precedence is lower or equal, pop the operators from the stack and add them to the postfix expression until an operator of lower precedence is found or the stack is empty. Then push the current operator onto the stack.
If a closing parenthesis is encountered, pop the operators from the stack and add them to the postfix expression until the opening parenthesis is found. Then discard both the opening and closing parentheses.
Once the infix expression has been fully traversed, pop any remaining operators from the stack and add them to the postfix expression.
The resulting postfix expression is the output.
The program uses a structure called Stack to implement the stack. The push function is used to push a character onto the stack, while the pop function is used to pop a character from the stack. The precedence function is used to determine the precedence of an operator. The infixToPostfix function takes the infix expression and the postfix expression as arguments and converts the infix expression to postfix expression. The main function takes the infix expression from the user using the fgets function, removes the trailing newline character, and passes it to the infixToPostfix function. The resulting postfix expression is then printed to the console.
