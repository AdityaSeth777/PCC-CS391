Question -> Write a program in C to evaluate a postfix expression


This C program is used to evaluate a postfix expression entered by the user.

A postfix expression is an expression in which the operator follows the operands. For example, "2 3 +" is a postfix expression equivalent to the infix expression "2 + 3".

The program uses a stack to evaluate the postfix expression. It scans the expression from left to right and pushes any numbers it encounters onto the stack. When it encounters an operator, it pops the two most recent numbers off the stack, applies the operator, and pushes the result back onto the stack. At the end, it pops the final result off the stack and returns it.

The main() function prompts the user to enter the postfix expression, reads it into a character array using fgets() function, and removes the newline character at the end of the string. It then calls the evaluate() function to compute the result of the expression and prints it to the console using printf().

The evaluate() function uses a stack to perform the postfix evaluation. It creates a stack using malloc() function, initializes the top of the stack to -1, and scans the input string one character at a time.

If a character is a digit, it is pushed onto the stack after converting it to an integer. If it is an operator, it pops the two most recent numbers off the stack, applies the operator, and pushes the result back onto the stack.

If there are any invalid characters in the input string, the program prints an error message and terminates using the exit() function.

At the end of the loop, the final result is popped off the stack and returned to the calling function. The stack is then freed using the free() function to prevent memory leaks.
