This program implements Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to traverse a graph. The program first takes input from the user, the number of vertices (n) and edges (m) of the graph. Then, it initializes an adjacency matrix (adj) of size n x n to represent the graph and an array visited of size n to keep track of visited vertices.

Then, the program takes input the edges of the graph and updates the adjacency matrix accordingly. For every edge (u, v), the program sets adj[u][v] and adj[v][u] to 1 to indicate that there is an edge between u and v.

Finally, the program performs DFS traversal starting from each unvisited vertex of the graph. It does this by iterating over all the vertices and calling the dfs function for each unvisited vertex. The dfs function takes a vertex v and marks it as visited. Then, it prints the vertex and recursively calls itself for all unvisited neighbors of v. The recursion continues until all vertices reachable from the initial vertex have been visited.

The program outputs the DFS traversal of the graph. This traversal may not be unique, as there can be multiple valid orderings of visiting the vertices in a graph using DFS.
