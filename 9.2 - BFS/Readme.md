This program implements BFS (Breadth-First Search) in C.

The program first defines a macro MAX_SIZE to define the maximum size of the graph. It then declares and initializes several arrays, including the adjacency matrix adj to represent the graph, the visited array to keep track of which vertices have been visited, and the queue array to keep track of the vertices to be visited.

The program then defines two functions: enqueue and dequeue. enqueue adds a vertex to the queue, while dequeue removes a vertex from the queue.

Next, the program defines the main function. It prompts the user to input the number of vertices and edges in the graph, initializes the visited and adj arrays, and prompts the user to input the edges of the graph.

The program then performs BFS traversal of the graph. It first iterates through all vertices in the graph, and for each vertex that has not been visited, it calls the bfs function. The bfs function initializes the vertex as visited, enqueues it, and then loops until the queue is empty. For each vertex in the queue, it prints the vertex, and then enqueues all of its unvisited neighbors.

Finally, the program prints the BFS traversal of the graph.

The time complexity of BFS is O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. This implementation uses an adjacency matrix to represent the graph, which has a space complexity of O(V^2).
